## 🚀 Getting Started - Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** 18.17+ or 20+
- **Package Manager:** npm, yarn, or pnpm
- **Supabase Account:** Free tier sufficient for development
- **API Keys:** OpenAI or Anthropic, YouTube Data API v3
- **Git:** For version control
- **Code Editor:** VS Code recommended (with Prettier, ESLint, Tailwind IntelliSense)

### Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project

```bash
# Create Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind
npx create-next-app@latest food-history-app --typescript --tailwind --app --use-npm

cd food-history-app

# Install core dependencies
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
npm install leaflet react-leaflet @types/leaflet
npm install openai anthropic                    # AI SDKs
npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
npm install framer-motion recharts lucide-react

# Install shadcn/ui
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card input textarea select
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog dropdown-menu tabs
npx shadcn-ui@latest add progress badge avatar
```

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (optional but recommended)
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project (or create new)
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Create tables from schema
supabase db push
```

**Or manually in Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Create new project
2. Run SQL from `BRAINSTORM-COMPLETE.md` Section 5 (database schema)
3. Enable Row Level Security on all tables
4. Create policies for student/parent access
5. Set up Storage buckets for file uploads

### Step 3: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your actual keys
# Get Supabase keys from: Project Settings > API
# Get OpenAI key from: platform.openai.com
# Get YouTube key from: Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services
```

### Step 4: Set Up Database Schema & Seed Data

```bash
# Option A: Run schema SQL directly in Supabase dashboard
# Copy from BRAINSTORM-COMPLETE.md Section 5

# Option B: Use migration files (if using Supabase CLI)
supabase db reset   # Creates all tables

# Seed content from specification files
npm run seed:units     # Imports Units 4, 5, 6
npm run seed:lessons   # Imports all lesson content
npm run seed:quizzes   # Imports quiz questions
npm run seed:geography # Imports map data
```

### Step 5: Create Essential Map Data Files

```bash
# Create geographic data directory
mkdir -p public/maps

# Download Natural Earth data (for base maps)
# Visit: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/
# Download: 1:110m Cultural Vectors (countries, admin-0)
# Download: 1:110m Physical Vectors (rivers, lakes)
# Convert to GeoJSON and place in public/maps/

# Create custom trade route GeoJSON files
# Based on coordinates from unit specifications
```

### Step 6: Implement Core Components

**Priority Order:**
1. ✅ Authentication (Supabase Auth with student/parent roles)
2. ✅ Dashboard layout (App Router structure, navigation)
3. ✅ Lesson display (Reading content, video embeds)
4. ✅ Leaflet map integration (Dynamic import, basic display)
5. ✅ Quiz system (Multiple choice, short answer, auto-grading)
6. ✅ Activity components (Interactive exercises with answer checking)
7. ✅ Progress tracking (Database updates, visualization)
8. ✅ AI tutor (OpenAI/Claude integration, context management)
9. ✅ Parent dashboard (Grading interface, progress reports)
10. ✅ Geography exercises (Click-to-answer maps, route tracing)

### Step 7: Test & Iterate

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000

# Test workflow:
# 1. Create student account (Timothy)
# 2. Create parent account (parent)
# 3. View Unit 4, Lesson 1
# 4. Complete reading section
# 5. Take quiz, submit answers
# 6. Complete map activity
# 7. Ask AI tutor question
# 8. Parent views progress dashboard
```

## 📋 Content Migration Strategy

**Challenge:** Convert 185,000+ words from Markdown specifications into structured database records.

**Approach:**

### Option A: Manual JSON Conversion (Recommended for Accuracy)

Create JSON files per unit matching database schema:

```json
// database/seed-data/units/unit-4.json
{
  "unit": {
    "id": 4,
    "title": "Ancient Mesopotamia & Egypt",
    "description": "Food in cradle of civilization...",
    "order": 4,
    "estimated_hours": 12
  },
  "lessons": [
    {
      "id": "unit-4-lesson-1",
      "title": "Beer Before Bread",
      "order": 1,
      "reading_sections": [
        {
          "order": 1,
          "title": "The Fertile Crescent: Geography and Agriculture",
          "content": "The Fertile Crescent, a crescent-shaped region...",
          "word_count": 1150
        }
        // ... more sections
      ],
      "videos": [
        {
          "title": "Mesopotamian Agriculture",
          "youtube_id": "...",
          "duration_minutes": 15
        }
      ],
      "activities": [
        {
          "type": "map_exercise",
          "instructions": "...",
          "correct_answers": {...}
        }
      ],
      "quiz": {
        "questions": [
          {
            "type": "multiple_choice",
            "question": "What does 'Mesopotamia' mean?",
            "options": ["Between rivers", "..."],
            "correct_answer": "Between rivers",
            "explanation": "The name comes from Greek..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then seed with scripts:
```bash
npm run seed:unit -- --file=unit-4.json
```

### Option B: Markdown Parser (Automated but Requires Validation)

Build parser script to convert Markdown specifications:

```typescript
// scripts/parse-unit-markdown.ts
import fs from 'fs'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

function parseUnitSpecification(filePath: string) {
  const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')
  
  // Extract structure:
  // - Parse headings for lessons/sections
  // - Extract quiz questions from markdown tables
  // - Identify video links
  // - Parse activity instructions
  // - Generate JSON matching database schema
  
  return {
    unit: {...},
    lessons: [...],
    quizzes: [...}
  }
}

// Usage:
npx tsx scripts/parse-unit-markdown.ts content/UNIT-4-COMPLETE-SPECIFICATION.md
```

**Validation Required:** Always manually review parsed JSON for accuracy before seeding database.

## 🗺️ Leaflet Integration - Detailed Implementation

### Installation & Setup

```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet
npm install -D @types/leaflet

# Import CSS in layout or global styles
# Add to src/app/layout.tsx:
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css'
```

### Fix Leaflet Icon Issue (Common Next.js Problem)

Leaflet marker icons don't load properly in Next.js by default. Fix:

```typescript
// src/lib/leaflet-setup.ts
import L from 'leaflet'
import icon from 'leaflet/dist/images/marker-icon.png'
import iconShadow from 'leaflet/dist/images/marker-shadow.png'

let DefaultIcon = L.icon({
  iconUrl: icon.src,
  shadowUrl: iconShadow.src,
  iconSize: [25, 41],
  iconAnchor: [12, 41],
})

L.Marker.prototype.options.icon = DefaultIcon

export default L
```

### Base Map Component

```typescript
// src/components/maps/LeafletMap.tsx
'use client'

import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup, useMap } from 'react-leaflet'
import L from '@/lib/leaflet-setup'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

interface MapProps {
  center: [number, number]
  zoom: number
  markers?: { lat: number; lng: number; popup: string }[]
  onMapClick?: (lat: number, lng: number) => void
}

export default function LeafletMap({ 
  center, 
  zoom, 
  markers = [], 
  onMapClick 
}: MapProps) {
  return (
    <MapContainer
      center={center}
      zoom={zoom}
      style={{ height: '500px', width: '100%' }}
      onClick={(e) => {
        if (onMapClick) {
          onMapClick(e.latlng.lat, e.latlng.lng)
        }
      }}
    >
      <TileLayer
        url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
        attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
      />
      
      {markers.map((marker, idx) => (
        <Marker key={idx} position={[marker.lat, marker.lng]}>
          <Popup>{marker.popup}</Popup>
        </Marker>
      ))}
    </MapContainer>
  )
}
```

### Dynamic Import Wrapper (Required for Next.js)

```typescript
// src/components/maps/InteractiveMap.tsx
'use client'

import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Leaflet requires browser window, so disable SSR
const LeafletMapNoSSR = dynamic(
  () => import('./LeafletMap'),
  {
    ssr: false,
    loading: () => (
      <div className="h-[500px] w-full bg-gray-100 animate-pulse flex items-center justify-center">
        <p>Loading map...</p>
      </div>
    ),
  }
)

export default function InteractiveMap(props: any) {
  return <LeafletMapNoSSR {...props} />
}
```

### Usage in Lessons

```typescript
// src/app/(student)/units/[unitId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx
import InteractiveMap from '@/components/maps/InteractiveMap'

export default function LessonPage() {
  const mesopotamiaMarkers = [
    { lat: 33.3152, lng: 44.3661, popup: 'Babylon - Ancient Capital' },
    { lat: 36.3489, lng: 43.1521, popup: 'Nineveh - Assyrian City' },
    // ... more cities from Unit 4
  ]
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Beer Before Bread: Mesopotamian Food Systems</h1>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Geography Activity</h2>
        <p>Identify the major cities of Mesopotamia:</p>
        
        <InteractiveMap
          center={[33.3, 44.4]}  // Center on Mesopotamia
          zoom={6}
          markers={mesopotamiaMarkers}
        />
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Geography Quiz Component (Click-to-Answer)

```typescript
// src/components/maps/MapQuiz.tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import InteractiveMap from './InteractiveMap'

interface MapQuizProps {
  question: string
  correctLatRange: [number, number]  // e.g., [33, 34]
  correctLngRange: [number, number]  // e.g., [44, 45]
  correctAnswer: string  // "Babylon"
  onCorrectAnswer: () => void
}

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
export default function MapQuizComponent() {
  const [isCorrect, setCorrect] = useState(false)
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Where was ancient Babylon located?</h3>
      <MapQuiz
        question="Click on the location of Babylon"
        correctLatRange={[32.5, 33.5]}
        correctLngRange={[44, 45]}
        correctAnswer="Babylon (near modern-day Baghdad)"
        onCorrectAnswer={() => {
          setCorrect(true)
          // Update progress in database
        }}
      />
      {isCorrect && <p className="text-green-600">Correct! Babylon was in Mesopotamia.</p>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Trade Route Visualization:**
```typescript
// src/components/maps/TradeRouteMap.tsx
import { Polyline, Tooltip } from 'react-leaflet'

const silkRoadPath = [
  [34.34, 108.94],  // Xi'an
  [39.91, 116.40],  // Beijing
  [41.69, 44.83],   // Tbilisi
  // ... more waypoints
  [41.90, 12.50],   // Rome
]

<Polyline
  positions={silkRoadPath}
  color="orange"
  weight={3}
  opacity={0.7}
>
  <Tooltip sticky>Silk Road Trade Route</Tooltip>
</Polyline>
```
